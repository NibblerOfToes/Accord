| Design Choice | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Colour Palette | I decided on a simple two colour design of white text on a navy blue background. It's basic but aesthetically pleasing, and the text is easily legible.  |
| Typography | I decided on the font 'Inter, as it is simple and easily legible. It is also one of the most professionally used fonts, so it works well with my website's design. |
| Image/Icon choice | I used a simple logo that will appear on the loading screen whenever the app is opened. I also used profile pictures for the messaging system, so that users can be distinguished. These profile pictures will be customisable for each user once the app is completed. |
