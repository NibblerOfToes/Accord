| Design Choice | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Colour Palette | I decided on a simple two colour design of white text on a navy blue background. It's basic but aesthetically pleasing, and the text is easily legible.  |
| Typography | I decided on the font 'Inter', as it is simple and easily legible. It is also one of the most professionally used fonts, so it works well with my website's design. |
| Image/Icon choice | I used a simple logo that will appear on the loading screen whenever the app is opened. I also used profile pictures for the messaging system, so that users can be distinguished. These profile pictures will be customisable for each user once the app is completed. |

| Design Choice | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Colour Palette | I kept majority of the colour palette the same in my alternate design, using the same navy blue and white. However, I changed some of the colouring on specific parts of my UI, such as making the navigation menu white rather than the previous dark blue.  |
| Typography | I decided to keep the font 'Inter', as it looks nice and is easily readable. |
| Image/Icon choice | My images and icons, such as the logo and profile pictures, remain the same in my alternate design. However, I did change the layout of some of the images, such as keeping the brand logo in the corner of every page now instead of just the loading screen. |
| Layout | Additionally, I changed the layout of my UI a lot as part of the alternate design. My design was mainly centered around changing the interface from a phone to a computer, meaning there is a lot more space on the screen to work with. This allowed me to leave more empty space on each of my pages to to create a more clean and aesthetically pleasing visual. Additionally, I moved a lot of the UI around, such as the navigation menu moving from the bottom to the side, as well as a complete redesign of the Home page and Timetable page. |
